                <h2>My Process</h2>
                    <p>I utilized the User Centered Design process and The Design Thinking process for this project.</p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <h4>Objective</h4>
                        <p>Enable anyone, anywhere to instantly chat with a professional in virtually any field.</p>
                    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                        <p>Users seeking expert advice need a way to connect with professionals in an efficient and timely manner because they need the support to develop solutions to their daily problems.</p>
                        <p>We will know this to be true when we see a growing use of the app and feedback from users that the advice which was given by the experts helped them solve their problems.</p>
                    <h4>Risk/Opportunity</h4>
                        <p>The risk for ProConnect is that there are many apps out there to connect with experts already. This one might get lost in the list of those available and make it hard to stand out.</p>
                        <p>Opportunity lies in combining features to create an app that more specifically meets user's needs. This could ultimately lead to the user being repeat customers and an increase in downloads.</p>

                      <p>Intro - This is a high rated app that utilizes celebrity and high-profile professionals. They market a video call and communication with the professional for their advice. Because of the high-profile experts, the calls are priced higher than other competitors.</p>

                        <p>Many potential users turn to Google first when needing an answer. The challenge for the Expert app is going to be how to get users to use the app instead of just Google.</p>                
                        <p>A lot of users want a quick answer from experts. Adding a feature for experts to post frequent questions may result in users purchasing 1-on-1 sessions to get more details.</p>
                        <p>It is not a common practice for users to reach out to someone regularly unless it is a medical professional so that may be a challenge for experts to get frequent sessions.</p>
                        <p>Many potential users were not so interested in becoming an expert unless there was a need for information they felt confident in knowledge or a monetary benefit. That could present another challenge in finding experts for the app.</p>

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <h4>User Personas</h4>
                        <p>Iâ€™d like to present Elias and Mary, two user personas representing the target audience for ProConnect app. After extensive research with potential users, Elias and Mary were created to reflect important needs, motivations and frustrations. Our target audience wants an easy to use and navigate app that connects people to help them gain answers and insight to their questions in their profession.</p>
                        <p>These user personas will assist us throughout the design process for ProConnect to ensure we are creating a useful, usable, and desirable product in all phases of the design stages.</p>

                    <h4>User Journeys</h4>
                        <p>From the user personas, I created a user journey to narrate the goals of the user and feelings as they went through their journey in the app.</p>

                    <h4>User Flows</h4>
                        <p>The user journeys helped me create a user flow that maps out the navigation and pages a visitor might interact with to complete their goal on the application.</p>

                    <h4>Site Map</h4>
                        <p>The next step in the design process was to create a sitemap. This is a structure that illustrates and organizes the heirarchy of the application. Once this sitemap was created, I conducted a card sorting survey to get the users input on how they would categorize the hierarchy of the application.</p>

                    <h4>Card Sorting</h4>
                        <p>â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹The card sorting results showed that participants categorized some of the topics and cards in less sections than I originally had. In my original Sitemap, I had 6 main topics from the dashboard, but these participants categorized the main sections into 4. This will make an easier and clear dashboard for users.</p>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                    <h4>Usability Test Plan</h4>
                        <p>Before beginning the usability test, it was important for me to create a usability test plan, a document that outlines the scope, goals, and logistical details of my session in advance.</p>
                    <h4>Usability Script</h4>
                        <p>Usability Script
                            With the Usability Test plan in mind, I created a usability test script. This is an outline of what I plan to say and communicate to my test participants. Scripts are incredibly useful and an important part of conducting an effective usability test.</p>
                    <p>Once I had all things in place, I conducted usability testing. I was able to test 6 participants who were all moderated remote tests with either their phone or computer. The tools I used were Google Meet and Screncast-o-matic.</p>
                    <h4>Usability Test Results</h4>
                        <p>I was able to collect the results from the usability tests and used affinity mapping to organize and categorize the participants quotes and errors.</p>

                    <h4>Rainbow Spreadsheet</h4>
                        <p>I then plugged the results into a rainbow spreadsheet which allowed me to itemize the errors and quotes from the usability test.</p>

                        <p>The results from the usability test and the analysis then needs to be put into a report with the top 5 issues and changes. This is what would be shared with the stakeholders and developers.</p>

                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                    <h4>UI Style Guide</h4>
                        <p>Now that the foundational design for ProConnect was complete, it was now time to refine the design.</p>
                        <p>I collected all of the design elements into a style guide. This would help clearly guide me in my design finalizations in making ProConnect a visually pleasing app as well as one the is user friendly and efficient.</p>

                    <h4>Collaborative Design</h4>
                         <p>With the UI detailed, I edited the wireframes to match the style guide details. I then shared my designs on a few forums to get feedback from other UX designers. I believe it is important to obtain feedback like this in order to keep true to the current design details and direction of UX.</p>
                    <h4>Final Design</h4>
                         <p>I finalized my design from the feedback I received and created a clickable prototype in Figma.</p>

                <!--conclusion section-->
                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                    <p>This was the most challenging yet rewarding projects that I've accomplished. Since this was the first structured app that I created, there were a lot of learning curves to go through. I did change the name of the app as well as the focus of the app from general to professional advice midway through which set me back slightly, but I was able to adjust and move forward.</p>
                    <p>I gained lots on insight on the process of UX design and feel confident in my ability to continue to improve the skills and tools I learned to be able to showcase growth and ability in knowledge base.</p>
                    <p>As I was doing this project, I was working full time, being a full time mom, and moved to a new town and job. So not only was it challenging in the context of learning but also in my personal goals of completing it while still showing quality in the project.</p>
                    <p>Given the time frame to complete the project, I would like to revise some areas that might have caused some confusion and refine some of my skills in using tools like Figma and Adobe. I would also like to get more feedback from users as well as professionals to determine other ways I can improve my design.</p>
